# Basic Shell Scripts

A collection of simple shell scripts I use for daily tasks like housekeeping, monitoring, and basic automation in Linux environments.

## Environment
- Linux-based OS (Preferably RedHat/Fedora family)
- Tested on CentOS, RHEL, and Fedora

## Todo / Upcoming Improvements
- [ ] Refactor scripts to follow shell scripting best practices
- [ ] Package scripts into RPM for easier distribution
- [ ] Add parameter support and improve documentation
